- Control groups (or cgroups) are a feature of the Linux kernel to
  group processes together and control or limit their resource usage
  (such as CPU, memory, and so on).

- In systemd, cgroups are primarily used to track processes and to
  ensure that all processes that belong to a service are terminated
  when a service is stopped.

- old way : stopping all dependent processes manually (with the ps and
  kill commands

- To address this limitation, systemd labels processes associated with
  a service using cgroups.

- The command =systemd-cgls= displays the cgroup hierarchy in a tree
  format

- =systemctl list-dependencies rsyslog.service=
  - dependencies must be started first
