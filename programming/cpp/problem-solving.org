How to solve ANY problem pg24

- Identify the Class (or classes in the problem)
  - A good clue to identifying the class(es) in the problem is to
    underline all the nouns and then see which are the most useful to
    solve the problem
- What DATA needs to be stored in the Class(es)
- What DATA TYPE(s) are needed to represent this data
- What METHOD(s) should be performed by the class
- Make a first attempt at the Class definition(s)
- How is EACH method to be implemented (what's the algorithm or each method)
- How can these methods be used to solve the original problem ie what
  is the algorithm of main()
