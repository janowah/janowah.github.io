<h1>ssh</h1>

<pre>
* how it works
id_rsa ; private key. kept with client
id_rsa.pub ; public key. goes on server. contains email address

user@server
~/.ssh/authorized_keys contains id_rsa.pub

user@client
~/.ssh/id_rsa

server will use key first if available
dirs must be 700. files 600

* commands 
ssh-keygen -t rsa ; generate ssh keys
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add -l ; list

* copy keys to locations on client and server
client location: (/home/homer/.ssh/id_rsa): 
passphrase: monkey
server location: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

* quick steps
1) create a public/private key pair on the client or server
   - =ssh-keygen -t rsa=
2) copy client key to ~/.ssh on client; private key should be 600
3) cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ; on server
4) $ restorecon -Rv ~/.ssh 
  
* server configuration
/etc/ssh/sshd_config 
- keys only and no root
  - PermitRootLogin no
  - PasswordAuthentication no

* client configuration
/home/homer/.ssh/config

Host myshortname realname.example.com
    HostName realname.example.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/realname_rsa # private key for realname
    User remoteusername

* other
- firewall rules
